<li>Open <code>mentors.md</code>. Add your name in the following format:</li>

<pre><code>    ## Chris von Csefalvay [github](http://www.github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay)

    ### Offering
    `R`, `Python`, `pandas`, machine learning, careers advice

</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Save the file and put in a pull request.</li>
<li>Mentees who are interested in your offering are going to contact you. It's up to you what you arrange between yourselves. </li>
<li>If you have as many mentees as you can handle or you can't take on anyone for the time being, let me know and I'll suspend you (or simply do it yourself by strikethroughing your name and putting it to the bottom of the list). You can always unsuspend yourself by re-entering your name or removing the strikethrough.</li>
<li>If you want to permanently quit the program, let me know and I'll remove your name (or you can do it yourself, too).</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="mentees" class="anchor" href="#mentees" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mentees</h2>

<ol>
<li>Look at mentees.md. Check if there is someone whom you might want to get in touch with.</li>
<li>If you can't find anyone who could mentor you, follow the same steps as above except for the <code>mentees.md</code> file.</li>
<li>Scour the <code>mentors.md</code> file every now and then.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>This is a safe space. We operate a zero tolerance policy for harassment, discriminatory behaviour, stalking and other creepy stuff. Please don't ruin this product.</li>
<li>Being a mentor invites you to be respectful towards your mentee and see your past self in him. Aspire to be the mentor you wish you had when you were learning.</li>
<li>Do not enter the programme to hire or get hired. Do not expect any benefit other than knowledge.</li>
<li>You can discuss your homework with your mentor if that would be permissible under your academic institution's honour code, but it's <em>your</em> homework. Don't make your mentor do your homework – you both lose out. </li>
<li>
<em>Stay safe</em>. It's your duty to look out for your own safety. Do not share more than you feel you need to – keep it strictly academic and professional. </li>
<li>Above all, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJFLvmjJY">be excellent to each other</a>.</li>
</ol>

<a id="faq" class="anchor" href="#faq" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h1>

<p><em>Q.</em> Why should I mentor?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> In med school, people are taught to 'see one, do one and teach one' – real knowledge is being able to teach somebody and pass on your own knowledge. This is a unique chance to find others who want help in what you might be knowledgeable at.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Can I be both a mentor and mentee?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Sure!</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> So is this in lieu of academic programmes? Or can I do both?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Joining a mentoring group might be useful if you are in an academic programme, whether a MOOC or conventional education: the effects of both are synergistic with each other.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I have a question you haven't answered!</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Cool! <a href="https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay">Let me know by e-mail</a>!</p>

<p>This is intended to be a safe space with absolutely zero tolerance for harassment, discriminatory conduct and creepy stuff. Please <a href="https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay">contact me</a> if you have had a bad experience with a mentor or mentee (and by bad experience, I mean issues that can't be resolved between the two of you, such as harassment).</p>
